    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Preparing the classic Korean dish bibimbap at home takes some time and planning, but it’s well worth it, whether you’re throwing a dinner party or just happen to love meal prepping. And while there is no definitive bibimbap recipe—versions made with steak, eggs, and broccoli rabe, a mix of spring vegetables, and more abound—the one constant is rice topped with an array of garnishes. Think lightly cured or cooked vegetables and proteins that play off of and balance one another, a helping of gochujang (Korean pepper paste), and sometimes a raw egg yolk or sunny-side up egg to help bring it together once you start mixing.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, bibimbap is made with cooked rice that’s been cooled and then crisped in a pan. The crispy rice may be cooked in and served from a hot stone bowl called a dolsot, but a cast-iron or other nonstick pan (and that ceramic serveware you just bought) will do fine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Carr1ot</li>
        <li>Spring Onion</li>
        <li>Bulgogi</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk first 6 ingredients in a medium bowl. Add beef; toss to coat. Cover; chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add rice; pat out in an even layer. Cook, rotating skillet for even browning (do not stir), until rice is golden and crisp on bottom, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat ½ tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add one-quarter of beef and cook, turning once, until cooked through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat in 3 batches with remaining oil and beef.</li>
        <li>Divide rice among bowls. Top with beef, Bibimbap Mix-Ins, and eggs. Serve kimchi alongside.</li>
    </ol>
