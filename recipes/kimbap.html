    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today I’m sharing an easy kimbap recipe. In Korea, we call it Yachae Kimbap (야채 김밥). It means vegetable kimbap and this is the most basic kimbap variety available in Korea.</p>
    <p>While the name indicates that it’s vegetable oriented, it’s not necessarily a vegetarian kimbap.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seaweed Sheets</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Spring Onion</li>
        <li>Crab Sticks</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the spinach and parboil it in rapidly boiling water (30 seconds to 1 minute). Drain the water away and run some cold water over the spinach. Gently squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water. Put the spinach into a bowl. Add 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil then mix them well.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat a pan/skillet. Add a small dash of cooking oil and spread it around the pan. Add the beaten egg and cook both sides well over medium heat. Place the egg omelette on a cutting board and cut it into long strips.</li>
        <li>In a heated pan, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks and kimbap ham (about 1 min per ingredients), separately, and over medium heat. (Some people use these raw, but I prefer cooking them first for my kimbap.)</li>
        <li>Place the cooked rice into a mixing bowl then add 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil and 1/4 tsp fine sea salt (or more to taste). Mix them well with a rice spatula.</li>
    </ol>
