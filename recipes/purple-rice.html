    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean purple rice is cooked Korean rice that has a purple hue. We call it heukmi bap (흑미밥) in Korean and it means black rice. But why do some people refer it as purple rice instead of black rice?</p>
    <p>Essentially they both mean the same thing. The only real difference would be the shades of rice depending on how much black rice you add to your base rice (i.e. white rice) when cooking. The color shades of purple can be light to deep dark purple. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White Rice</li>
        <li>Black Rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the rice into the rice cooker inner pot and rinse the rice until the water is clear. (You will need to do 3 to 4 rounds of rinsing.) Drain the water well.</li>
        <li>Cover the rice with the water (1:1 ratio) and close the lid. Set the rice cooker to “백미 (baekmi)” setting. If your Cuckoo has an English mode, it may say “glutinous rice”.</li>
        <li>Wait until the rice cooks and switch to the keep warm setting. It takes 23-26 mins to complete. Fluff the rice with the rice paddle. Serve or store it for later. (Refer below for storage guide)</li>
    </ol>
